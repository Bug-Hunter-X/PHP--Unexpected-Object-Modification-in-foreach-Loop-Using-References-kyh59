This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in PHP related to references and object modification within loops. The `bug.php` file illustrates the incorrect code, leading to unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected code and explanation. The core issue lies in the use of references (`&`) within the `foreach` loop, which unintentionally modifies all objects in the array rather than each object individually. The README provides a detailed explanation of the issue, the solution, and best practices for avoiding this error.
