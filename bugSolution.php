The solution is to avoid using references in the foreach loop.  The correct approach is to iterate without using references: ```php class MyClass { public $value = 0; public function increment() { $this->value++; } } $objects = []; for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) { $objects[] = new MyClass(); } foreach ($objects as $object) { $object->increment(); } //Correct output: Each object's value will be 1. foreach ($objects as $object) { echo "Object value: ".$object->value.\n"; } ``` By removing the `&`, each iteration works with a copy of the object, preventing unintended side effects and ensuring that each object has its own independent value.
